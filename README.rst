MyCoastLCS is a python package developped within the EU Interreg project MyCoast to perform Finite Time Lyupanov Exponent calculations and extract Lagrangian coherent structures.
The code currently supports two lagrangian model outputs: LAGAR and PyLag but extension to other packages should be trivial. In addition to calculating FTLE following Shaddon 2005 it 
also estimates concentrations and residence times. The combination of all this aspects can results in qualitative water quality indicators.
